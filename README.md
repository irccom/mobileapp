# IRC.com Mobile Application Beta

A mobile IRC client that keeps you connected to the IRC.com network, complete with push notifications, message history and designed with a simple interface to be usable by anybody.

The interface is built around the KiwiIRC web client and re-uses the majority of its source.

## Open Source
As part of the KiwiIRC.com open source project this application will be open sourced as a generic multi network IRC client in the near future. We are working on making sure a solid base for the application is working first and in live tests before opening its source the world.

## What's working
We are now at a feature freeze stage as we complete and polish everything currently in the application for version 1.0
* Registering new accounts
* Logging into the IRC.com network
* Basic IRC usage for
  - sending messages
  - joining channels
  - managing channels
  - searching channels
  - etc
* Persistent connections
* Push notifications
* Controlling the entire app without IRC command knowledge
* Message history when opening channels or private messages

## Immediate roadmap before version 1.0
* Colour theming with dark and light themes
* Avatar uploads
* Channel invite manager
* Improving parts of the UI responsiveness
